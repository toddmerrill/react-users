# Welcome to my Users app!  

Some people write [To Do lists](http://todomvc.com/), I write master/detail apps with a list of
users on the left, and an auto-saved input form on the right.       [See Demo](http://toddmerrill.com/react-users)

This one is a 'serverless' app implemented with React, Redux and ES6 on the
front-end, with AWS API-Gateway and DynamoDB on the back-end.

For the AWS connection, I wrote a promise-based universal API available [here](https://github.com/toddmerrill/users-api).
